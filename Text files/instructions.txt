How to run our shell:
1. In the terminal, install: 'sudo apt install gcc meson libgtk-3-dev libxml2-dev libgirepository1.0-dev xsltproc'
2. Then enter in 'sudo apt install glade'
3. Make sure you are in the correct directory path '/cs4310_a4'
4. Enter 'make'
5. Enter './gladewin' 
6. An external terminal should open with the current directory path printed.

Now you are able to run our shell with the assignment's supported commands:
*cd <directory name> - will change your directory if it exists under the parent folder. Supports '..'

*pwd - will display the current working directory.

*mkdir <directory name> - will create a new child directory with the given name unless it already exists.

*rmdir <directory name> - will remove the directory unless it is not empty. Will output an error message if not empty.

*ls <directory name>(optional) - will list the contents of specified directory. If no directory is specified, lists contents of current directory.

*cp <file name to be copied> <file name copied to> - will copy the contents of the first listed file to the other.

*exit - will exit the shell.

*'./<executable name> > <new file name>.txt' - this command runs executables, but our shell will write the output to a txt file.
